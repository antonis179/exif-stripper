<b>Exif Stripper removes private information from your photos stored as image metadata (exif) so you can share them safely.
</b>

This is an open-source project. The code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/antonis179/exif-stripper">https://github.com/antonis179/exif-stripper</a>.

Images you take with your phone contain a lot of metadata - some are benign, while others put your privacy at risk:

• GPS location / direction
• Camera make / model (this will be your device make and model)
• Date and time
• Software (the app used to process the image on your device)

Exif Stripper can show you the metadata in your photos as well as delete them.

<b>Current Features:
</b>
• Remove metadata from an image
• Save or Share the stripped images
• Share an image to the app directly from your gallery

<b>Under development:
</b>
• Option to remove meta-data from multiple images at once
• Option to monitor specific folders and automatically remove image meta-data as new images are taken

If you have a feature idea you would like to see in the app please let me know.
