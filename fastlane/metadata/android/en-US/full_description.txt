<b>Photo Stripper removes private information from your photos stored as image metadata (exif) so you can share them safely.
</b>

This is an open-source project. The code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/antonis179/exif-stripper">https://github.com/antonis179/exif-stripper</a>.

Photos you take with your phone contain a lot of metadata - some are benign, while others put your privacy at risk:

• GPS location / direction
• Camera make / model (this will be your device make and model)
• Date and time
• Software (the app used to process the image on your device)

Photo Stripper can show you the metadata in your photos as well as delete them.

Any data gathered by this application cannot be used to identify you. Some data gathering is required to serve ads and
perform bug fixing (see the <a href="https://appert.home.blog/photo-stripper-privacy-policy/">privacy policy</a>).
The app can be used offline and if you would prefer no data gathering you can build the app from source
making any required changes.

By downloading this app you agree to the privacy policy.
